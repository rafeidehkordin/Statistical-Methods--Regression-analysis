Predict Student Performance in Exam using Regression (linear and logistic)

I.	Introduction: 
 a regression analysis on dataset of student performance in exams was conducted. For the types of regression, linear regression and logistic for different measurement were performed. Linear regression, in this case, uses to find factors affect math score, while logistic model is used to see how gender effect other random variables.

II.	Dataset Description: 
The dataset of student’s performance was taken from Kaggle.com and including all variables and information. There is 13 column and 1000 rows, but in this project, we try to analyze 3 types variable. For analyzing, we try to use R as a main tool and additional library such as ggplot, PerformanceAnalytics, and dplyr.

III.	Conclusion:
Applying logistic regression shows that gender is not predictable using other random variables. In addition, applying regression model is fitted to know the students’ performance, especially what factors effect students’ math score.
